## 🧠 Clustering Result Interpretation

- **Cluster 0**: High income, high spenders → Potential loyal customers
- **Cluster 1**: Low income, low spenders → Low priority segment
- **Cluster 2**: Moderate income, varied spending → Need deeper analysis
- *(Actual labels may vary depending on cluster numbering)*
